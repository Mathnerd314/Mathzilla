# mathml-ctop and mathml-mml3ff

Source of the MathML-ctop and MathML-mml3ff add-ons and the scripts to generate
them. They essentially apply [David Carlisle's ctop stylesheets](http://web-xslt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ctop/) to MathML elements.

Users should report any bug to the
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/fred-wang/Mathzilla/issues).

To build the extension, edit the config file
(if necessary) and type `make`. You should find generated `mathml-ctop.xpi` and
`mathml-mml3ff` files.
