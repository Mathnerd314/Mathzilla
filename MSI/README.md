# MSI

**This package is no longer maintained. Cambria Math is installed by default on
Windows 7 and higher and is usable with Firefox 31 or higher, so this installer
is becoming obsolete.**

This directory contains the source of the MathML fonts Windows installer.
Instructions on how to build it are given in `MathML-fonts.wxs`.
